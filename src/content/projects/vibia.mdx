In 2023 I joined [Vibia](https://vibia.com), a global lighting company based in Barcelona, Spain. This new role presented not only a challenge but also the opportunity to travel abroad, so I thought _"why not"_ and moved to __Barcelona__ for a few months.

## 3D USER INTERFACE

Besides from _center divs as my primary job_, I also had the opportunity to contribute in the development of a __React__ application with a 3D user interface powered by __Three.js__.

    <source src='/projects/vibia/video.mp4' type="video/mp4" />

The application response the need to offers their clients a visual representation of the final product and its configurations before completing an order.

## EXPERIENCE

On top of working with new and interesting frameworks and libraries, this position allowed me to reinforce and expand my knowledge in diverse practices and principles:

+ Pair Programming.
+ Domain-Driven Design.
+ Test-Driven Development.
+ Centralized Repository Architecture.
