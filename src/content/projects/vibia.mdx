In 2023 I joined [Vibia](https://vibia.com), a global lighting company based in Barcelona, Spain. This new role presented not only a challenge but also the opportunity to travel abroad, so I thought _"why not"_ and moved to __Barcelona__ for a few months.

## 3D USER INTERFACE

Besides from _center divs as my primary job_, I also had the opportunity to contribute in the development of a __React__ application featuring a 3D user interface powered by the __WebGL API__, through the powerful capabilities of both __Three.js__ and __React Three Fiber__ libraries.

The application response the need to offers their clients a visual representation of the final product and its configurations before completing an order.

+ Domain-Driven Design.
