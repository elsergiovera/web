In 2023 I started a new job in [Vibia](https://vibia.com), a global lighting company based in Barcelona. This presented the possibility of going abroad, so I thought, _"why not"_ and went to __Barcelona, Spain__ &#128205;.

Not only the trip to a new city was exciting, but the job that was waiting for me was very exciting too. 
For a while I've been wanted to work with the new Front End technologies that I've been learning and this was the perfect opportunity to do that and even more.
