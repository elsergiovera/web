I spent most of my 2023 between _Spain_ and _Chile_, wich meant I went to an almost 1 year long summer. I started a new job in <a href="https://vibia.com/" target="_blank">__Vibia__</a>, a global lighting company based in Barcelona, with the possibility of going abroad for a few months if I really wanted to, so I decided to say _"why not"_ and went on a trip to _Spain_.

<ul>
<li>Domain-Driven Design</li>
<li>Pair Programming</li>
</ul>

Not only the trip to a new city was exciting, but the job that was waiting for me was very exciting too. 
For a while I've been wanted to work with the new Front End technologies that I've been learning and this was the perfect opportunity to do that and even more.
