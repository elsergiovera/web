I've always enjoyed the simplicity of games like Wordle and wanted to give it a purpose beyond guessing random words, a way to learn something new every day.<p />
That's how <b>WADAI</b> was born — a fun twist on the classic daily puzzle, but inspired by world festivities!

### From the __README.md:__

> ### &#128213; Introduction
> Welcome to **WADAI**, a daily word-guessing game with a global twist.
>
> Each day, the game selects a festivity celebrated somewhere in the world on that date. Your challenge is to guess it in five tries.
>
> Whether it's Christmas, Diwali, 18 de Septiembre, or a national holiday you’ve never heard of, **WADAI** turns cultural discovery into a daily puzzle.
>
> ### &#128640; Features
> - **Festivity-based Words**: Every day's word comes from a real celebration or cultural event happening somewhere around the world..
> - **Wordle-style Gameplay**: You have *5 attempts* (represented by the letters WADAI) to guess the festivity of the day.
> - **Global Awareness**: Learn about holidays, traditions, and events across different cultures.
> - **One Game per Day**: A new festivity unlocks every 24 hours!
>
> ### &#128308; Demo
> You can find a live demo here: [wadai.veraserg.io](https://wadai.veraserg.io).
