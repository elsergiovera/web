Have you ever been in the middle of a gaming session, and between ranked matches you switch to music or a video, but the game's audio keeps blasting over everything? <br />
Muting it manually every single time is annoying, right? — Well, that's why I built **MUTEN**.

**MUTEN** is a lightweight Windows app that automatically silences applications when they lose focus and restores their audio when you switch back. It lives quietly in your system tray, letting you pick which apps to **muten** — once selected, they only play sound when their window is active.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
    <img src="/projects/muten/tray.png" alt="MUTEN system tray menu" width="300" />
</div>

Click the tray icon and you'll see all your active audio sessions — just click on any app to **muten** it. Highlighted apps are currently muted, and they'll automatically unmute when you bring them back into focus.
